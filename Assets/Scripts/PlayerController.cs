// Maybe start by trying to add controles and get it moving left right etc, in accordance to camera.
// Then try adding a new speed when pressing x, which makes the chicken swich to the running animation.
// Then we can try adding the egg respawn script and a respawn animation.
// Start with a cube egg.
// And do the respawn logic stuff.
// Then we need to think of adding a jump.
// Could try making simple animation too.
